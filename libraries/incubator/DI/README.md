# The Joomla/DI Package

The Joomla! **Dependency Injection** package provides a powerful `container-interop` (upcoming `PSR-11`) compatible
Inversion of Control (IoC) Container for your application.

This is a *copy* of the latest 2.x version of the package. It will be installed via composer, once it is released.
